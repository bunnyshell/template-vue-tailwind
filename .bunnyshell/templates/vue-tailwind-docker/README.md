# Template overview

This Bunnyshell environment [template](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/templates-what-are-templates) is an example of how to build a Vue3 + TailwindCss static site (with Vite) and serve it from a container, supporting remote development.

## Template specifics

The experience is similar to Vercel or Netlify: push code to the repo and Bunnyshell will build and serve your static site.
The differences are:

- that the application is served by a node server (via `vite serve` - the command is configurable)
- remote development is possible: you can edit files locally with your IDE, and see the updates in real-time in your cloud environment

### Environment Variables

Environment variables that start with `VITE_` are made available at build time and accessible via `import.meta.env`. Set environment variables from Bunnyshell.

As an example, this template exposes `VITE_APP_NAME` at build time.

## How to use this Template

You can create Environments from a [Bunnyshell Template](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/templates-what-are-templates);

## Remote Development

[Remote Development](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development) allows you to develop directly in a cloud environment, therefore eliminating all inconsistencies and approximations of traditional local environments.

The code is executed in a container running in Kubernetes, while being synchronized real-time with your local folders.

ðŸ“– For more information on how Remote Development works in Bunnyshell, please see the [dedicated documentation](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development).

ðŸ§± Remote Development can only be started from the CLI, so you will need to [install the Bunnyshell CLI](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/bunnyshell-cli-install) installed and to [authenticate in the CLI](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/bunnyshell-cli-authentication).

&nbsp;

### Start a Remote Development session

In order to start a Remote Development session, you must run a command from the CLI:

```bash
bns remote-development up --component {COMPONENT_ID}
```

The exact command can be copied from the UI: go to the Environment details screen, select the desired Component, then *Remote Development*. In case you do not specify the `component` flag, the CLI will guide you through using a wizard.

After starting the Remote Development session, the Bunnyshell CLI opens a shell into the container. From it, you can run any application-related command you would run on local.

This template also contains a reference to a Remote Development profile, `php_dev`, which defines the reverse port-forwarding on the debugger's port (`9003` for `xdebug`) and the command needed to start the php-fpm process upon starting a Remote Development session.  
ðŸ“– You can check out more in the `.bunnyshell/rdev.yaml` file in the repository or [in the documentation](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-sharing-configuration).

```bash
$ bns remote-development up --component {YOUR_COMPONENT_ID}
/var/www # 
```

- [with local files](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-local-files)
- [with remote files](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-remote-files)

&nbsp;

### Stop a Remote Development session

In order to stop a Remote Development session, you must run the complementary command for `up` from the CLI:

```bash
bns remote-development down --component {YOUR_COMPONENT_ID}
```

ðŸ“– For more information on stopping a remote Development session, please see [Stop Remote Development](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-stop)

&nbsp;

### Debugging in a Remote Development session

You can debug your code even if it's running in a container in Kubernetes, just like you would on your local machine: use breakpoints, control the flow of execution, see variable values and call stacks etc.

The configuration differs based on the way you chose to work, and also on your IDE of choice.

&nbsp;

ðŸ“– For more information on debugging locally, please see:

- [Debugging remotely with VS Code](https://documentation.bunnyshell.com/docs/remote-development-configure-vs-code)

You must change all passwords and review all parameters to ensure that your Environment is secure.
